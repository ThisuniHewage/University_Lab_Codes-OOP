# University Lab Codes - OOP  
**Object-Oriented Programming Module (2025)**  
*Java Lab Sessions, Practice Codes & Concept Demonstrations*



This repository contains **all the Java codes** I wrote during my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** university module — including:

- Weekly lab session exercises  
- Practical assignments  
- In-class concept demonstrations  
- Extra practice codes I wrote to strengthen my understanding

It's my personal learning journal for mastering the core pillars of OOP in Java.
