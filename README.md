# University Lab Codes - OOP  
**Object-Oriented Programming Module (2025)**  
*Java Lab Sessions, Practice Codes & Concept Demonstrations*



This repository contains **all the Java codes** I wrote during my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** university module — including:

- Weekly lab session exercises  
- Practical assignments  
- In-class concept demonstrations  
- Extra practice codes I wrote to strengthen my understanding

It's my personal learning journal for mastering the core pillars of OOP in Java.

### Core OOP Concepts Covered
| Concept                  | Folder / Examples                              |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Classes & Objects        | Basic class demos, constructors                |
| Inheritance              | `Unidirectional Association`, `Bidirectional Association` |
| Polymorphism             | Method overriding, runtime polymorphism        |
| Abstraction              | Abstract classes, interfaces                   |
| Encapsulation            | Private fields + getters/setters                |
| Association              | One-to-one, one-to-many relationships         |
| Aggregation & Composition| Real-world modeling examples                   |
| Exception Handling       | Try-catch, custom exceptions                   |
| Dependency               | Loose coupling examples                        |

### What I Learned
- How real-world entities are modeled using classes and objects
- The power of **inheritance** and **code reuse**
- When to use **composition over inheritance**
- Designing clean, maintainable, and scalable code
- Handling runtime errors gracefully with exceptions
- Writing code that follows SOLID principles (as much as possible at this stage!)

> This module made OOP finally "click" for me — from theory to actual working code.

### Tools & Environment
- **Language**: Java (SE 17+)
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA 
- **Build Tool**: None (pure Java files)

---

**Proudly built (and debugged) line by line during late-night lab sessions!**
